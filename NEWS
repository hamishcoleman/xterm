                            Patch #332 - 2018/04/15

     * add a GetChecksum item to disallowedWindowOps
     * improve  notes  in  ctlseqs.ms which mention where various controls
       originated.
     * add  control  sequences  for  querying  the  X display size and the
       character  size,  both  in  pixels  to  help  eliminate some of the
       constants in esctest.
     * fixes prompted by review of George Nachman's esctest script:
          + add a null-pointer check and a limit-check in xtermCheckRect.
          + correct   limit-check   for   right-margin   when   processing
            autowrapping if xterm is not built for wide-characters.
          + repair  logic  in  RIS to reset 132-column mode when an escape
            sequence is used to enable 80/132-column switching.
          + correct array-limit for EWMH working state.
          + further improve limit-checks versus assert's (see patch #315).
          + correct  order of check-margins and move-to-left margin for DL
            and IL.
          + modify  reverse-wrap to pay attention to top/bottom margins as
            it has done for left/right margins since patch #279.
          + modify  behavior of DECFI and DECBI to not index the screen at
            the  left/right  edge of the display unless those happen to be
            the left/right margins.
          + add case for VT320 DSR response for keyboard status.
     * improve   check   for  valid  shell  path  using  getusershell  and
       endusershell  if  available,  in  case  /etc/shells  does not exist
       (suggested by Rainer Orth).
     * modified configure checks for groff and man2html, to use the latter
       by  default,  but  allowing  mandoc  as  a  partial replacement for
       former.
     * revisited  the  inconsistent  copyright  notices mentioned in patch
       #165,  and  eliminate  the  issue  as  mentioned  in this copyright
       discussion.
     * fix typo in this change-log (report by Sven Joachim)
     * update config.guess, config.sub
